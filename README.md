Low-Level Design (LLD) Practice Repository
Welcome to the Low-Level Design (LLD) repository!
This collection is dedicated to practical, hands-on learning of LLD essentials with a focus on clean code and real-world implementation.

üìñ About This Repository
Daily Coding Practice
Sharpen LLD skills by tackling daily exercises modeled on problems commonly found in interviews and scalable system design.

Mini-Projects & Design Pattern Implementations
Explore concise C++ examples of popular design patterns and system-level logic as seen in industry projects and system interviews.

Code-First, Theory-Minimal Approach
Each folder provides clearly structured C++ code. The emphasis is on implementation; the repository does not include extended theory or documentation, making it ideal for those who learn by example.
